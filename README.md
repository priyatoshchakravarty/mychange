# Reverse Fizz Buzz

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a classic childrens game that has made it's way into coding for fun.
The problem can be described with following rules:  

- for the given integers `f`, `b` and `n`, write a program that prints the numbers 1 to `n`
- for multiples of `f` print "Fizz"
- for multiples of `b` print "Buzz"
- for multiples of `f` and `b` print "FizzBuzz"
- for other cases print the number

## So... what is reverse FizzBuzz?

We have `n` values of FizzBuzz output, but we do not know the `f` and `b` values.
Using the FizzBuzz output as the input to our program, find original `f` and `b` values (so called "Multiplier Values").

For example, if the input is `"1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"` 
then the output should be `3 5`.

## What else to consider?

Simply solving such a problem is not massively impressive. **The interesting part is how you approach the problem.**  
When solving this puzzle, please do the following:

- take notes of your thought process
- write a description of how you approached the challenge (~500 words)
  - what was challenging for you?
  - did your view on the problem change while working on it?
- write your code in a good style and document it

**This whole challenge should not take more than 2 hours.**  
If you cannot solve all of the inputs in that time, this is not a problem! 
Focus on the above mentioned parts about documenting your logical approach and high-quality coding.

Please fork this repository and work on your solution in your own repository. Let me know when you are done.
